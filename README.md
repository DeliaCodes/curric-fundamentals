# Welcome to Programming Fundamentals

## How To Use This Content

Over many years of teaching programming to students with completely different backgrounds we have found that there is no one size fits all content. Some people prefer to learn using written content, for others videos are way easier to digest.

In all our courses we give you multiple variations of the same content and an exercise at the end to help you verify understanding of the material. In some cases you can use only one of variations and go straight to exercise, in others using both variations will help you strengthen your understanding of complex topics.

Either way, we welcome any feedback you have about the material - don't be shy and press the chat button and tell us what you think about the material or share it with your mentor.

## How To Study Effectively

We recommend the following practises to help you study more effectively:

1. Make notes.
Doesn't matter what variation of content you have selected make notes especially written ones helps you to remember material. If you prefer to make electronic notes we recommend to reword content instead of copying it into your notes. When you use your own words to describe a concept it creates [more connections in your brain](http://hilt.harvard.edu/files/hilt/files/notetaking_0.pdf) which helps to remember material. 

If you are looking for a way to organise notes we have found [Cornell Notes](http://coe.jmu.edu/learningtoolbox/cornellnotes.html) method to be a good fit for many different styles of note taking.

2. Take breaks.

With intense mental tasks such as studying or programming it's important to keep healthy routine to avoid burning out. Research[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/02/110208131529.htm] shows that prolonged mental activity leads to diminishing returns overtime due to hard to notice mental fatigue.
