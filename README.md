# Welcome to Programming Fundamentals

## How To Use This Content

Over many years of teaching programming to students with completely different backgrounds we have found that there is no one size fits all content. Some people prefer to learn using written content, for others videos are way easier to digest. 

In all our courses we give you multiple variations of the same content and an exercise at the end to help you verify understanding of the material. In some cases you can use only one of variations and go straight to exercise, in others using both variations will help you strengthen your understanding of complex topics.

Either way, we welcome any feedback you have about the material - don't be shy and press the chat button and tell us what you think about the material or share it with your mentor.
